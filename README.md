# SQL-employee-tracker

An employee tracker application built with node.js and SQL.

### Description
The attached project file(s) are for our tenth challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to build from scratch a command-line application that allows a user to keep track of a company's departments, roles within those departments, and the employees who occupy those roles.

The project was a good learning experience that helped me understand how SQL and node.js / JavaScript can be used in conjunction to manage and manipulate data.

### Installation
In order to use the application, clone the GitHub repository link and run node.js on your local machine.

### Usage
This application is free to use.

### Credits
This project was created with helpful collaboration from bootcamp group 3, as well as my instructors, TAs, and my tutor (Erik Hirsch) from UC Berkeley.
